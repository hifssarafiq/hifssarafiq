Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a junior data analyst named Hifsa Rafiq.
I have a strong interest in data and its ability to provide insights. My areas of expertise as a Junior Data Analyst are data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. I process, analyze, and show data in meaningful ways using Python and well-known tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I like taking on data challenges, and I'm constantly picking up new methods to hone my analytical abilities.


What I do:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Using Pandas to deal with missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.
Analyzing data involves utilizing NumPy and Pandas to explore datasets, spot trends, and produce insights.
Data Visualization: Presenting findings through the creation of understandable, educational graphics with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Statistical analysis is the process of interpreting data and making inferences using statistical techniques.
Tools & Technologies:
Python is my preferred programming language for analyzing data.
Pandas: For cleaning and manipulating data.
NumPy: For manipulating arrays and doing numerical calculations.
For displaying data and producing eye-catching charts, use Matplotlib with Seaborn.
Jupyter Notebooks: For sharing findings and interactive data analysis.
My current projects include honing my machine learning and predictive analytics abilities.
constructing data pipelines to automate operations related to analysis.
investigating cutting-edge visualization strategies to successfully convey findings.
